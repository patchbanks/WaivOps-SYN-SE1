## SYN-SE1 Dataset

SYN-SE1 is an open audio dataset containing archived recordings of a Studio Electronics SE1 analog synthesizer. It includes 1,000 one-shot audio samples recorded in uncompressed stereo WAV format, labeled by note key across a two-octave range. The presets encompass a variety of distinct synth bass and lower-pitched lead sounds, featuring filter modulations and spatial stereo imaging, providing a valuable resource for soundfont design, audio production, and training data for generative AI models.

The primary purpose of this dataset is to provide accessible content for machine learning applications in music and audio. Potential use cases include pitch detection, musical note classification, audio synthesis, music information retrieval (MIR), sound design, and signal processing.


**Specifications**

- 1,000 audio samples
- 16-bit WAV format
- Key note labeled samples
- JSON reference
- Analog synth bass and leads
